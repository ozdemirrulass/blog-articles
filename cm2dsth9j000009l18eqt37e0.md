In every project, I have a hard time deciding where to place the theme toggle and how to design it. It may seem simple, and many might not think much of it, but I know there are others out there who share my obsession. So, I'm determined to resolve this once and for all.  
  
Like all of you I also browse the web a lot and seeing all kinds of designs and I think Iâ€™ve seen every kind of implementation of this. However Iâ€™ve decided the best way of implementing this is using radio inputs and for the design aspect I like the way vercel handles it.

It looks quite good right?  
  
Letâ€™s check how does my implementation looks like.

Wellâ€¦ I guess that could be better, because the border of the icon and the border of the surrounding div donâ€™t align. Still, itâ€™s good enough, and Iâ€™ll leave it to you to fix it. ðŸ¤“
